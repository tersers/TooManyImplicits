Move Constructor
- all of the below are true:
	- No user-decl move ctors
	- No user-decl copy ctors
	- No user-decl copy asgn
	- No user-decl move asgn
	- No user-decl dest
	- Implicit move ctor is not deleted (until C++14)
- Or, = default

Deleted/Undefined:
T has non-static data members that cannot be moved (have deleted, inaccessible, or ambiguous move constructors);
T has direct or virtual base class that cannot be moved (has deleted, inaccessible, or ambiguous move constructors);
T has direct or virtual base class with a deleted or inaccessible destructor;
T is a union-like class and has a variant member with non-trivial move constructor;
T has a non-static data member or a direct or virtual base without a move constructor that is not trivially copyable. (until C++14)
The deleted implicitly-declared move constructor is ignored by overload resolution (otherwise it would prevent copy-initialization from rvalue). (since C++14)

Trivial:
- it is not user-provided (meaning, it is implicitly-defined or defaulted);
- T has no virtual member functions;
- T has no virtual base classes;
- the move constructor selected for every direct base of T is trivial;
- the move constructor selected for every non-static class type (or array of class type) member of T is trivial;
- T has no non-static data members of volatile-qualified type. (since C++14)
