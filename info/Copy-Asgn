Copy Assignment
- No user-def copy ctor
- Or, = default

Signature:
- (const T&) if:
	- base class is (const B&) or (B)
	- all non-static members have (const M&) or (M)
- otherwise, has signature of (T&)
- you can have both with = default

Deleted/Undefined:
- Deleted if:
	- T has a user-declared move constructor;
	- T has a user-declared move assignment operator.
- Otherwise, defaulted.
- Deleted if:
	- T has a non-static data member of non-class type (or array thereof) that is const;
	- T has a non-static data member of a reference type;
	- T has a non-static data member or a direct or virtual base class that cannot be copy-assigned (overload resolution for the copy assignment fails, or selects a deleted or inaccessible function);
	- T is a union-like class, and has a variant member whose corresponding assignment operator is non-trivial.

Trivial:
- it is not user-provided (meaning, it is implicitly-defined or defaulted) , , and if it is defaulted, its signature is the same as implicitly-defined (until C++14);
- T has no virtual member functions;
- T has no virtual base classes;
- the copy assignment operator selected for every direct base of T is trivial;
- the copy assignment operator selected for every non-static class type (or array of class type) member of T is trivial;
- T has no non-static data members of volatile-qualified type. (since C++14)
