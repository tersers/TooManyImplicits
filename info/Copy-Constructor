Copy Constructor
- No user-def copy ctors
- Or, = default

Signature:
- Signature is (const T&) if
	- base class is (const B&) or (B)
	- all non-static members have (const M&) or (M)
- otherwise, has signature of (T&)
- you can have both with = default

Deleted/Undefined:
- T has non-static data members that cannot be copied (have deleted, inaccessible, or ambiguous copy constructors);
- T has direct or virtual base class that cannot be copied (has deleted, inaccessible, or ambiguous copy constructors);
- T has direct or virtual base class with a deleted or inaccessible destructor;
- T has a user-defined move constructor or move assignment operator;
- T is a union-like class and has a variant member with non-trivial copy constructor;
- T has a data member of rvalue reference type.
(since C++11)

Trivial:
- it is not user-provided (that is, it is implicitly-defined or defaulted) , and if it is defaulted, its signature is the same as implicitly-defined (until C++14);
- T has no virtual member functions;
- T has no virtual base classes;
- the copy constructor selected for every direct base of T is trivial;
- the copy constructor selected for every non-static class type (or array of class type) member of T is trivial;
